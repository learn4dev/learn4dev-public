        <h3>Expert Groups</h3>
        <p>
            Expert Groups are a major pillar of the learn4dev network.
            Each is founded when at least three members of the network 
            propose to form a group and join efforts to work on a 
            specific topic. While some groups might choose to focus on 
            knowledge sharing, others work towards developing learning 
            programmes or training materials.


        </p>
        <p>
            Besides regular exchange 
            among members of an Expert Group, each selects a leader to 
            represent the Expert Group and reports on its activities at learn4devâ€™s Annual Meeting.
