        <p>
            Although you can browse through most of the site without giving 
            any information about yourself, in some cases, personal 
            information is required in order to provide the service you 
            need. In this respect: for each specific e-service, the 
            webmaster determines the purposes and means of 
            the processing of personal data.

        <h3>How do we treat enquiries you send us?</h3>
        <p>
            You will find a "Contact" form located at the bottom of each
            page, which activates  our software to send your requests to 
            a specific functional mailbox. When you send such a message, your personal data is 
            collected only to the extent necessary to reply.
        </p>
